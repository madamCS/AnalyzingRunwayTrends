# Data, But Make it Fashion
_Analyzing trends as seen on high-fashion runways using Python._

In the example AnalyzeTrends.py file, we demonstrate how DBMIF uses python to analyze trends from high-fashion collection. By using image recognition models to detect trends in images, we are able to see what percentage of the collection displays each trend. Thus, DBMIF publishes what is trending as well as what is on the uprise.

Our sample file uses Chanel's SS20 Ready-to-Wear runway show's looks as an example. You can view pictures of each look in the collection [here][chanel-ss20].
